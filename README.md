# ICD2O RST 2025

For this RST, you will design and code a **text-based adventure game** using Python, first in **CMU** and then in **Codespace**. This project gives you the opportunity to practice key programming skills, such as:

- Working with variables.
- Using input and output functions.
- Writing if statements.
- Creating loops.

Your game will be an **interactive story** where the player makes choices that shape how the adventure unfolds. You get to choose the theme of your game—it could be exploring a haunted house, surviving in space, going on a medieval quest, or any other idea you find exciting!

## **Project Requirements**

### **CMU Scene**
- Your adventure should start with a **CMU scene** that introduces the game.
- Showcase the programming concepts you’ve learned this year. The more concepts you use, the better your mark can be.
- Complete the CMU portion in **Unit 3 - Creative Task**.
- Use the CMU scene to:
  - Set the stage for the adventure.
  - Provide some initial options or context before transitioning to Codespace for the main game.

### **Codespace Game**
- Open with a description of how the adventure will unfold, including:
  - The rules of the game.
  - Directions the user needs to know.
- Throughout the game:
  - Use **variables** to track the player’s name, items, health points, or progress.
  - Use **input** functions to allow the player to make decisions.
  - Use **print** statements to show the story, options, and outcomes.
- Include:
  - **Branching storylines** with at least four major decision points where choices affect the game.
  - **Loops** for retrying actions or exploring areas.
  - **Two different endings** based on player choices.
- Add comments in your code to explain its functionality.

## **Grading Criteria**
This assignment will be graded on:
- **Creativity**.
- How well your code runs without errors.
- Effective use of **variables** and **loops**.
- Inclusion of **decision points** and **endings**.
- Overall **readability** and **user-friendliness**.

### **Tips**
- Plan your story before coding. A simple **flowchart** can help map out decision points.
- Test your game regularly to catch and fix errors.
- Keep the story engaging but simple.
- Account for user mistakes in their input to ensure smooth gameplay.

## **RST Schedule**

### **Day 1**
- Create a **cheat sheet** (one-page handout) to refer to while coding your CMU scene or Python program in VS Code.
- The cheat sheet will be printed and accessible in class. No other resources (e.g., old work, W3Schools) will be allowed.

---

### **Day 2 + Day 3**
- Develop your **CMU scene** based on the story you’ll create on Days 4 and 5.
- The scene should:
  - Reflect your story.
  - Include interactive elements that the user can engage with.
- You will be marked on:
  - **Creativity**.
  - How well the scene relates to your story.
  - Meeting curriculum criteria as per the rubric.
- Use code from **Units 1 to 3**.
- The more detailed and interactive your scene, the better your mark.

---

### **Day 4 + Day 5**
- Open your repository and create your **text-based game** in Codespace.
- Test your game while creating it.
- The adventure should:
  - Provide options for the user.
  - Use inputs, print statements, variables, if statements, and functions.
- Commit your work daily.
- Submit the **repository URL** to the Google Classroom assignment.
- Include a short paragraph (~100 words) in the attached document explaining the **theme** and **main features** of your game.
